# Swasthya Sathi — PWA Testing Guide

## ✅ PWA Features Implemented

This document describes how to test and verify all Progressive Web App (PWA) features of Swasthya Sathi.

## 🔧 Service Worker & Caching

### Current Strategy
- **HTML Pages**: Network-first (try online first, fall back to cache)
- **Assets (CSS, JS, Images, Fonts)**: Cache-first (use cached, update in background)
- **Cache Version**: `swasthya-sathi-v4`
- **Auto-updates**: Cache purges old versions on activation

### Features
✅ App shell caching for offline support  
✅ Automatic asset versioning  
✅ Cross-origin request filtering  
✅ Graceful fallback to /index.html for 404 routes

## 📱 Install Prompt (Phones & Tablets)

### How It Works
1. **Detection**: Browser detects PWA-capable device after user interaction
2. **Banner**: Non-intrusive install prompt appears in-app
3. **Install**: User taps "Install phone" (or "Install for tab" on tablets) to add to home screen
4. **Standalone**: App runs fullscreen without browser UI

### Where to Find It
- **Location**: Fixed banner at bottom-left (mobile) or bottom-right (desktop)
- **Code**: [src/components/pwa/InstallAppBanner.tsx](../src/components/pwa/InstallAppBanner.tsx) + [src/components/pwa/DesktopAppBanner.tsx](../src/components/pwa/DesktopAppBanner.tsx)
- **Logic**: [src/hooks/usePwa.ts](../src/hooks/usePwa.ts), [src/hooks/useDesktop.ts](../src/hooks/useDesktop.ts)

### Device-Specific Wording
- **Phone** → "Install phone"
- **Tablet** → "Install for tab"
- **Desktop PC** → "Install the desktop app" (installs the PWA with its own window)

### Testing on Mobile
**Chrome/Edge on Android:**
1. Open http://localhost:5173/ on phone
2. Wait 3-5 seconds for page to load completely
3. Look for install prompt at bottom of screen
4. Tap "Install phone" (or "Install for tab" on tablets)
5. App installs and appears on home screen

**Safari on iOS 15+:**
- Tap Share → Add to Home Screen
- (Safari doesn't show automatic prompt, but home screen add still works)

### Manual Install Trigger
If automatic prompt doesn't appear:
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab
2. Check "Offline" to simulate PWA environment
3. Prompt may appear after reload

## 🖥️ Desktop Install (PC)

### How It Works
1. **Detection**: App detects a desktop computer (fine pointer + hover)
2. **Banner**: "Install the desktop app" prompt appears in the bottom-right
3. **Installable browser (Chrome/Edge/Opera)**: "Install now" opens the browser's real install dialog — the app installs as a standalone window (no browser tabs)
4. **Other browsers (Firefox/Safari)**: Shows per-browser steps (menu → Install App / File → Add to Dock)

### Native Title Bar (Window Controls Overlay)
When installed on desktop Chromium and the window opens in overlay mode, the app draws its own draggable title bar with the logo and OS badge; the OS provides minimize/maximize/close in the top corner.

### Testing on Desktop
1. Open http://localhost:5173/ in Chrome or Edge on a PC
2. The "Install the desktop app" banner shows in the bottom-right
3. Click "Install now" → confirm the browser install dialog
4. Launch the installed app — it opens in its own window, no browser UI
5. Verify the title bar area is draggable to move the window

## 🌐 Offline Functionality

### What Works Offline
✅ All cached pages and routes  
✅ Patient dashboard (cached shell; live API data shown when online)  
✅ Navigation and sidebar  
✅ CSS, JavaScript, images all cached  
✅ "Limited Connection" banner visible  

### What Doesn't Work Offline
❌ Live API calls (real data requires the backend; local cached data may load)  
❌ New external resources not yet cached  
❌ Real-time updates  

### Testing Offline Mode

**Method 1: DevTools Offline Simulation**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application → Service Workers
3. Check "Offline" checkbox
4. Reload page → Should load from cache
5. Uncheck to go back online

**Method 2: Airplane Mode**
1. Enable airplane mode on device
2. Refresh app → Should work from cache
3. Try navigation between pages
4. Disable airplane mode to restore connection

**Method 3: DevTools Throttling**
1. DevTools → Network tab
2. Set throttle to "Offline" in dropdown
3. Reload → App works from service worker cache

### Offline Indicator
- **Banner**: Shows "Limited Connection" with WiFi-off icon when offline
- **No banner**: Means you're online (we removed the "Connection restored" message)

## 🎯 Manifest & App Configuration

### Location
[public/manifest.webmanifest](../public/manifest.webmanifest)

### Configuration Details
```json
{
  "name": "Swasthya Sathi",                    // Full app name
  "short_name": "Swasthya Sathi",             // Home screen label
  "description": "Connecting Every Village to Better Healthcare",
  "start_url": "/",                           // Launch page
  "display": "standalone",                    // Hide browser UI
  "display_override": ["window-controls-overlay", "standalone"],  // Native title bar on desktop
  "orientation": "portrait",                  // Mobile orientation
  "background_color": "#f5faf7",              // Splash screen color
  "theme_color": "#0b6b3a",                   // Status bar color
  "icons": [
    {"src": "/logo.png", "sizes": "any", "purpose": "any"},
    {"src": "/icons/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "purpose": "any"},
    {"src": "/icons/icon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "purpose": "any"},
    {"src": "/icons/icon-maskable.png", "sizes": "512x512", "purpose": "maskable"}
  ]
}
```

### Key Settings
- **Display Mode**: `standalone` = fullscreen app, no browser chrome
- **Display Override**: `window-controls-overlay` enables the native draggable title bar on installed desktop apps
- **Orientation**: `portrait` = locks to portrait on phones (can rotate with device)
- **Theme Color**: `#0b6b3a` = brand green for status bar on Android
- **Icons**: Maskable icon supports adaptive icons on Android 12+

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Install Prompt Not Appearing
**Solution:**
1. Ensure page loads completely (wait 3+ seconds)
2. Trigger user interaction (scroll, click)
3. Check: Is service worker installed? (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)
4. Try on different device or browser (Chrome/Edge works best)
5. iOS: Manual install via Share → Add to Home Screen
6. Desktop (Firefox/Safari): use the on-screen "How to install" steps instead

### Issue: Desktop Banner Shows "How to install" Instead of "Install now"
**Cause:** The browser did not fire `beforeinstallprompt` (Firefox, Safari, or install already dismissed).
**Solution:** Follow the on-screen steps for your browser — Chrome/Edge install from the address-bar icon, Firefox from the ☰ menu, Safari from File → Add to Dock.

### Issue: Service Worker Not Updating
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Go to DevTools → Application → Service Workers
3. Unregister old service worker
4. Close all tabs of the app
5. Reload page
6. Service worker should re-register with new version

### Issue: App Still Shows Old Content After Update
**Solution:**
1. Cache version updated to `v4` after rebuild
2. Service worker auto-purges old cache on activation
3. Clear browser cache manually: DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data
4. Full reload or hard refresh

### Issue: Offline Banner Stays On
**Solution:**
1. Check actual network status
2. If using DevTools "Offline" mode, uncheck it
3. If in airplane mode, disable it
4. Restart browser if stuck

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### For Production (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

1. **HTTPS Required**
   - PWA requires HTTPS in production
   - Dev server (localhost) works with HTTP
   - Service worker won't register over HTTP

2. **Service Worker Path**
   - SW file at `/public/sw.js` serves as `/sw.js`
   - Ensure web server doesn't cache the SW file itself
   - Add headers: `Cache-Control: no-cache` for `/sw.js`

3. **Manifest Path**
   - Located at `/public/manifest.webmanifest`
   - Server from root as `/manifest.webmanifest`
   - Include in `<link rel="manifest">` in index.html

4. **Assets**
   - All icons in `/public/icons/` must be accessible
   - CSS and JS bundles auto-cached by SW

5. **Testing Production Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:4173 (preview server)

## 📈 PWA Score (Google Lighthouse)

Expected Lighthouse scores:
- **Performance**: 85-95 (cached assets + minimal JS)
- **Accessibility**: 90-95 (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- **Best Practices**: 90-100 (HTTPS ready, PWA manifest valid)
- **SEO**: 90-100 (meta tags, mobile-friendly)

To run Lighthouse:
1. DevTools → Lighthouse tab
2. Select "Mobile" for phone testing
3. Run audit → Get detailed report
